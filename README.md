# Algorand Remote MCP Lite (Wallet Edition)

Algorand Remote MCP Lite is a wallet-first Model Context Protocol server for Algorand. It is a trimmed version of the full remote MCP, intentionally limited to 40 tools to keep the surface area focused on agentic wallet workflows. It runs on Algorand Mainnet by default and signs transactions server-side using HashiCorp Vault.

## Architecture

- MCP server on Cloudflare Workers (Durable Object) that registers wallet, transaction, and API tools.
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE and OIDC-compatible social login (Google, GitHub, Twitter/X, LinkedIn) for user identity.
- HashiCorp Vault transit signing via the `HCV_WORKER` service; private keys never leave the vault.
- Algod + Indexer APIs for on-chain state and transaction submission.
- KV namespaces for OAuth sessions, vault entity mapping, verified assets, ARC-26 QR/receipt caching, and AP2 storage.

## Design

- Wallet edition: minimal, curated tool set that behaves like an agentic wallet.
- Server-side signing: the LLM never receives mnemonics or private keys.
- Mainnet-first: examples and defaults target mainnet assets and apps.
- Modular tooling: wallet, transactions, indexer, NFD, Pera verified assets, and Tinyman swaps are separate tool groups.

## OAuth + OIDC and Agentic Wallets

- Users authenticate via OAuth/OIDC providers; approval and PKCE flows are handled in `src/oauth-handler.ts` and `src/oauth-provider.ts`.
- After login, `ensureUserAccount` binds the social identity (provider + email) to a Vault entity and transit key.
- The wallet address is derived from the Vault public key and used as the agent wallet.
- Signing tools (`wallet_sign_transaction`, `wallet_sign_atomic_group`) use Vault transit so signatures are produced inside Vault.

## Features

- Agentic wallet operations: balance, assets, signing, and submission without exposing secrets.
- On-demand topup using Algorand ARC-26 QR codes (`generate_algorand_qrcode`).
- AP2 mandate generation for intent, cart, and payment flows (`generate_ap2_mandate`).
- Receipt generation with QR codes for payments and asset transfers (`generate_algorand_receipt`).
- Atomic transaction groups and asset workflows (opt-in, transfer, USDC opt-in).
- Verified asset discovery via Pera Wallet and NFD lookups.
- Tinyman swaps for fixed input and fixed output trades.

## Resources (5)

- Wallet Account Public Key (`algorand://wallet/publickey`): Returns the vault public key (base64) and role for the configured wallet.
- Wallet Account Address (`algorand://wallet/address`): Returns the wallet address derived from the vault public key.
- Wallet Account Information (`algorand://wallet/account`): Returns account balance and asset holdings for the configured wallet.
- Wallet Account Assets (`algorand://wallet/assets`): Returns the asset list for the configured wallet.

## Usage

### Local development
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure `wrangler.jsonc` vars and secrets (Algod/Indexer URLs, OAuth client IDs/secrets, Vault worker URL/token).
3. Start the worker: `npm run dev`

### OAuth flow (high level)
1. A client requests `/authorize` and chooses a social provider.
2. The user authenticates, then `/callback` exchanges the code for tokens.
3. The server binds the identity to a Vault keypair and exposes wallet tools.

## Notes

- This server is configured for Algorand Mainnet by default; update `ALGORAND_NETWORK`, `ALGORAND_ALGOD`, and `ALGORAND_INDEXER` if you need to point elsewhere.
- ARC-26 QR codes are intended for on-demand topups and user-friendly funding flows.
